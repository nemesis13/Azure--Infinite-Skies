    A scenario can do the following:
    -preload (assets)
      This is done implicitly. Derived classes have to define what to preload
      in lists.
    -prepare
      Optional explicit preparations that need multiple frames, implemented as
      generator.
    -begin
      Required explicit code part that describes a part of game.
    -end
      A derived class can end itself or be ended from outside (through core
      FSM). Scenario class implicitly cleans up after this.
